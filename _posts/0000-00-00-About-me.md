> I am a bit of a renegade, constantly trying to escape the social labels. I trained as a economist and am now trying to grow up and be a real world social scientist. I have a touch of radical and a touch of pragmatist within me. Don't trust me, just read me.

>> Currently, I am  a Research Fellow in Economics of Built Environment at the [The Bartlett School](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). <br> Before that I was a lecturer at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) from 2007 to 2017. <br> Before that I obtained my PhD at [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Prof. Maitreesh Ghatak](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ghatak/) and [Prof. Oriana Bandiera](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/facultyPages/OrianaBandiera.aspx). 

>>> My research is primarily focused on applied microeconomic and macroeconomic theory. I love teaching and have taught a wide range of courses in my career hitherto.

>>>>   I am enthusiastic about programming, web designs and Argentinian tango.
