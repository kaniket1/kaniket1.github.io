I am a bit of a renegade economist, always trying to escape the box in which I am supposed to think. I trained as a economist and am now trying to grow up and be a real social scientist. I am a bit radical a bit conventional. Don't trust me, just read me.

I am currently a Research Fellow in Economics of Built Environment at the [The Bartlett School](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/construction/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). 

I am a lecturer at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). I trained as an economist at the [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk) obtaining a Ph.D under the supervision of [Prof. Maitreesh Ghatak](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ghatak/) and [Prof. Oriana Bandiera](http://www.lse.ac.uk/economics/people/facultyPages/OrianaBandiera.aspx). His research is primarily focused on applied microeconomic theory and economic development. He teaches a wide variety of courses at the Cambridge.
